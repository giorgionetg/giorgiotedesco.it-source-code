# How Bitcoin works

### Abstract

All cryptocurrencies works at the almost same way. Cryptocurrencies are based on a [**Peer to Peer** (P2P) network](https://www.giorgiotedesco.com/the-blog/on-cryptocurrencies/what-is-a-p2p-network). Down here we cover multiple arguments inerhit how cryptocurrencies works:

* **The Peer**, the central unit where the code cumputes the actions to do.
* **Public Key and Private Key**, how are is generated and how difficult are to decipher.
* **The Proof of Work protocol**, the core job to generate block.
* **The Block' structure**, probably most easy part to understand.

At the end of reading you will be able to understand the basics. Each section here it is only a little overview of how the bitcoin and cryptocurrencies works. In the next months I will deeply going over any section below.

### **The Peer**, the unit where the code cumputes the actions to do.

The **BitCoin Core** software works as a **Peer** in a network composed by thousand of peer (that's why most of people call it: decentralization). The two main task of a peer are:

* storing an identical copy of all blocks of the blockchain.
* staying update with the network.
* Bitcoin Core could be used as:
  * Wallet, there are a lot of Wallet software that are lighter and more easy to use.
  * Miner, probably today only big companies use to mine Bitcoin. For common user it has an energy cost to do not undervaluated. **At this mode**: it is here where Proof of work protocol is working.

Currently you don't know yet about the:

* **Public Key**, we will cover soon at the next section.
* **Private Key**, important to know right now it is: Peer does not save any Private Key, at this layer of knoledgement: **peer is agnostic**.

### **Public Key and Private Key**, how are is generated and how difficult are to decipher.

The **Address** or **Public Key**, it is the code to share with your friends and with business's people and get the payments! **Take care that if you share your main Public Key, people knows how many bitcoin you own**. So, attention to the **Privacy**, the privacy concern about BitCoin is completely misinterpreted, there is no privacy between payments (if I send some bitcoin to your main address/public-key, and you have shared your main address/public-key, I can read and know all your payments you did).
But in a context where you know how to operate, the Public Key and the sharable address that it is the same, works exactly like your **IBAN** or **Swift** code.
The **Public and Private keys** are strictly connected together. With **Private Key** it is an easy and fast task to generate the **Public Key**, by the way the inverse path it is the one most difficult process that exists (a super computer could do it in about more than billion billion of years, let me say: don't try this at home).
